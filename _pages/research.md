I am interested in Geometric and Enumerative Combinatorics, Ehrhart Theory, Convex and Discrete Geometry. I am also interested in Optimization with its application to Public Transport Networks.

**Bivariate Chromatic Polynomials of Mixed Graphs** [[PDF](https://matthbeck.github.io/teach/masters/sampada.pdf)]
-------------

For an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, the chromatic polynomial counts the number of vertex colourings as a function of the number of colours. Stanley’s reciprocity theorem connects the chromatic polynomial with the enumeration of acyclic orientations of the graph $G$. Beck, Bogart, and Pham proved the analogue of this reciprocity theorem for the strong chromatic polynomials for a mixed graph $G = (V, E, A)$. Dohmen–Pönitz–Tittmann provided a new two-variable generalization of the chromatic polynomial of undirected graphs. 

We extend this bivariate chromatic polynomial to mixed graphs, provide deletion-contraction formulae and prove a theorem which enumerates the chromatic polynomial of mixed graphs via the decomposition into the sum of bivariate order polynomials. Using this decomposition, we also prove a reciprocity result for the bivariate chromatic polynomials of mixed graphs.

As a part of a group from the [REACT](https://sites.google.com/view/react-2021/home-page) workshop, we are working on a project related to order polytopes and Ehrhart theory.
