<!-- For an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, the chromatic polynomial counts the number of proper vertex colourings as a function of the number of colours. Stanley’s reciprocity theorem connects the chromatic polynomial with the enumeration of acyclic orientations of the graph $G$. Beck, Bogart, and Pham proved the analogue of this reciprocity theorem for the strong chromatic polynomials for a mixed graph $G = (V, E, A)$. Dohmen–Pönitz–Tittmann provided a new two-variable generalization of the chromatic polynomial of undirected graphs. 

We extend this bivariate chromatic polynomial to mixed graphs, provide deletion-contraction formulae and prove a theorem which enumerates the chromatic polynomial of mixed graphs via the decomposition into the sum of bivariate order polynomials. Using this decomposition, we also prove a reciprocity result for the bivariate chromatic polynomials of mixed graphs. -->

**Abstract**: The bivariate chromatic polynomial $\chi_G(x,y)$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$, introduced by Dohmen-Pönitz-Tittmann (2003), counts all $x-$colorings of $G$ such that adjacent vertices get different colours if they are $\leq y$. We extend this notion to mixed graphs, which have both directed and undirected edges. Our main results is a decomposition formula which expresses $\chi_G(x,y)$ as a sum of bivariate order polynomials (Beck-Farahmand-Karunaratne-Zuniga Ruiz 2020), and a combinatorial reciprocity theorem for $\chi_G(x,y)$.

As a part of a group from the [REACT](https://sites.google.com/view/react-2021/home-page) workshop, we are working on a project related to order polytopes and Ehrhart theory.
